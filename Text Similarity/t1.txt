Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. NLP enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. It encompasses a wide range of tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering.
