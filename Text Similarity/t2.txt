Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. It relies on patterns and inference instead of explicit programming. Machine learning algorithms are used in various applications, including data mining, pattern recognition, and predictive analytics. They are essential for tasks such as recommendation systems, image recognition, and autonomous vehicles
